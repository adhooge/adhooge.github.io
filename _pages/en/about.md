I am currently pursuing a PhD in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) on _Developing AI tools to assist guitar tabs composition_. This thesis is supervised by [Louis Bigo](http://louisbigo.com), <a href='http://deguernel.discordia.fr'>Ken Déguernel</a> and <a href='http://cnrs.magiraud.org'>Mathieu Giraud</a>.

My work is made with the support of the French National Research Agency, in the framework of the project TABASCO (<a href='http://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-22-CE38-0001'>ANR-22-CE38-0001</a>).

Besides research, I also teach computer science at _Université de Lille_.

On my free time, I play guitar in a French rock band, play in a brass band, roll dice in TT-RPGs, and I like to read on the little time that is left.
